# react-dsfr-types

This repository contains Typescript types definitions for the [@dataesr/react-dsfr](https://github.com/dataesr/react-dsfr) package.

react-dsfr is the "Non-official React components of the official french Système de Design de l'État."

⚠️ This is very much work-in-progress.

All files were initially autogenerated thanks to [react2dts](https://github.com/KnisterPeter/react-to-typescript-definitions) 🙇‍♂️

This repository will probably get deleted if we manage to merge this into [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/).

## what was done so far

```sh
# recursive copy js files from repo
rsync -R ~/dev/react-dsfr/src/**/*.js ./

# remove tests
find . -name __tests__ -prune -exec rm -rf {} \;

# auto convert proptypes to d.ts files + remove js files
find components -name '*.js' -exec bash -c 'cat "$1" | npx react2dts --top-level-module true > "${1%.js}".d.ts' - '{}' \;
```
